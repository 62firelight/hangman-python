## Notes
* Pretty much all of the code is left unmodified from when the program was finalized in April 2018, along with all the (rather excessive) comments. However, I did comment out one debug statement that would print out the answer every round. 
* The `old` folder contains all of the older versions of the program. I had no idea that Git existed at the time, so I resorted to the rather painful method of saving the program as a new file with a different version number.
